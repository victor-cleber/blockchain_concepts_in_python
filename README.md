# Blockchain concepts implemented in Python

In 2008 someone using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto described how cryptology and an open distributed ledger can be combined into a digital currency application using blockchain. 
These are some of the advantages which stand out in the actual use of technologies:
- distributed ledger
- decentralization
- information transparency
- tamper-proof construction
- openness
Its advantages extended the application of blockchain technology from digital currency and into finance, and other fields including health care, supply chain management, market monitoring, smart energy, and copyright protection. In summary, blockchain consists of a chain of blocks, and its blocks contain transactions. All blocks are connected through hashing, and there is no company or central bank to verify if a transaction is valid or not.

> "For individual businesses, it is important to understand the effects of blockchain applications on the organizational structure, mode of operation, and management model of the business. For the market as a whole, it is important to determine whether blockchain can resolve the market failures that are brought about by information asymmetry and whether it can increase market efficiency and social welfare. However, understanding the mechanisms through which blockchain influences corporate and market efficiency will require further academic inquiry."  (Xu et al, 2019)
